                <h3>Obstacle Course Racing:</h3>
                <p>
                    A personal challenge that I picked
                    up to encourage myself to get more
                    active and fit. It is not only a 
                    physical challenge (i.e. a 10ft wall,
                    100lb weight,etc.), but the mental
                    challenge of convincing yourself
                    that you can complete the race itself.

                <h3>Paintball:</h3>
                <p>
                    Starting roughly 5 years ago I began playing
                    at Friendly Fire Paintball in Upton,MA. From
                    there I have gone on to play at massive games
                    at Albrightsville, PA at Skirmish Paintball's 
                    "Invasion of Normandy" event. I love the sport
                    dearly and also pursue it to this day with my
                    mother and father accompanying me on the 
                    battlefield.

                <h3>Bowling:</h3>
                <p>
                    A hobby that I picked up during my high
                    school years that I actually had a talent
                    for. We played regionally as well as against
                    other teams across the state. I still play
                    recreationally to this day.

                <h3>LARP:</h3>
                <p>
                    Live Action Role Play or LARP is an activity
                    /event that I had picked up around March 2018.
                    It is an outlet of escape in which I take on 
                    a fake persona to practice my improvisation
                    skills as well as have some genuine fun screaming
                    about nothing of importance.
